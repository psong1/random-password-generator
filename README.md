# Random Password Generator

## Description

This project is a random password generator that includes different criteria to generate a password. The criteria included are:

- A minimum character length of 8
- A maximum character length of 128
- At least one:
    - Uppercase letter
    - Lowercase letter
    - Number
    - Symbol

If each criteria is met, a random password will be generated with the user's specified character length. If each criteria is not met, a password will not be generated and the text box will be empty.

* When the user clicks "Generate Password", a prompt will ask how many characters they would like in their password.
